# Thank You for Looking to contribute
Full warning this is my first time being a caretaker for an open source project. Although I don't anticipate much usage your patience is appreciated.

## General rules for contributing 

 - This is a JsDoc project, functions should probably be well documented
 - Changes should be loosely coupled and un-opinionated, we want minimal impact on other changes and functions here possible 


## AI code policy
It is fine and possibly encouraged to use AI tools such as co-pilot. That said please make effort to that code is original and is still maintained to be human readable. You may be asked to explain code as if you wrote it. 

Personal opinion, the main reason I love jsdoc is that it is good for tailoring AI tools to provide exactly what you want. So please do use this as a test bed.

## Recommended Vs-Code extensions
There is no reason to code the way I do but these are tools I use which can be quite handy .
