# JsUseDocs - core

A tool/library to parse and alter jsdocs in files with the intent on supporting JsDoc and JsDoc style comments on code. This is to feed a later project to develop a interactive GUI for jsdocs however can act as a stand alone.

The idea is not just to make it easier to work with jsdocs but also to be able to make it easily exapndable to support plugins and custom tags, for example to add react or electron specific comments. Adherence to jsdoc standards is not strictly promised. 

# this is not in a stable format at this time. I do not reccomend any use
